   - `brew install node`
 - npm (recommended 5.3.0)
   - npm is shipped with NodeJS. but to have a specific version installed see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9755841/how-can-i-change-the-version-of-npm-using-nvm).

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-mobile.git
cd lisk-mobile
npm install
npm run start
```

### Development environment
You can run the project in Xcode and use iOS simulators or alternatively use Android simulators. There are several options to set up your Android development environment. Please read [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for more info.

Three is a standalone app for debugging React Native. it has React and Redux debugger enabled by default. Please read  [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) for more info.

#### Environment variables
You can fill out `env.json` with those variables:
```
network             -> Lisk network's name, can be mainnet or testnet.
passphrase          -> Passphrase of your LSK account, to be filled out automatically on login.
secondPassphrase    -> Second passphrase of your LSK account, to be filled out automatically on send process.
useCommercialFonts  -> Tells styleGuide/fonts.js file to load commercial fonts instead of Open Sans.
```

In order to avoid commiting that file you can follow [this approach](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3320183) as following
```bash
$ git update-index --assume-unchanged env.json
```

### Using Commercial Fonts
Since some of the fonts used in the production version are commercial, this repository only contains open source fonts and uses `Open Sans` as a replacement for the commercial ones.

If you have licensed copies of `Basier Circle` and `Gilroy`, you can add them to [fonts folder](./src/assets/fonts) with the naming convention stated in [`styleGuide/fonts.js`](./src/constants/styleGuide/fonts.js) file and make sure all the fonts are linked.

```bash
$ react-native link ./src/assets/fonts
```
